## ðŸ’¡ Iterations:

### **Iteration 0: Project Setup and Main Page**
- Initialize the project by forking and cloning the repository.
- Examine the existing codebase to understand its structure.
- Ensure all team members and the instructor are collaborators on the repository.
- Create the main page with a randomly selected poster, image, title, and quote.
- Implement the "Show Random Poster" button to display a new random poster when clicked.

### **Iteration 1: Switching Views**
- Build the form view for creating custom posters and the saved posters view.
- Implement functionality to hide the main poster and show the appropriate view when buttons are clicked.
- Enable users to switch between the main poster, form, and saved posters views seamlessly.

### **Iteration 2: Creating a New Poster**
- Develop the new poster form view where users can input images, titles, and quotes.
- Implement the "Show My Poster" button to create a new, unique poster object and save the submitted data.
- Ensure the form view transitions back to the main poster view, displaying the newly created poster.

### **Iteration 3: Saving & Viewing Posters**
- Create functionality to save the current main poster to the savedPosters array when the "Save This Poster" button is clicked.
- Prevent duplicate saves of the same poster.
- Build the "Show Saved Posters" view to display all posters in the savedPosters array.

### **Iteration 4: Deleting Saved Posters**
- Add the ability to delete a saved poster when a user double clicks it.
- Implement this functionality without using HTML `onclick` attributes; instead, use JavaScript.

## ðŸ’¡ Extensions (Optional):

- Implement data validation and error handling in the form.
- Allow users to click individual parts of the main poster (image, title, quote) to update them with random items.
- Create a modal to view saved posters in larger detail.
- Enable users to drag and drop saved posters to reorder them.
- Explore additional features that enhance user experience without breaking existing functionality.
